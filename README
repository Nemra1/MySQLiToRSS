2/ About

    MySQLiToRSS is a PHP file that generate a RSS 2.0 feed based
    on content stored in a MySQL database.
    It handles sorting by date, the use of HTML in the
    description of an item, which allow to render the article as
    it appears in the feed reader, excepted for the CSS sheets,
    and multitag articles.
    It is based on Version 2.0.11 of the RSS 2.0 specification,
    the most up to date at the time of writing this software.

    Some optional items are missing because I do not use them.
    I might add them later (some or all).
    I will be pleased to add optional items if requested.

3/ Installation

    cp rss/index.php.dist rss/index.php

    2/ Edit the file rss/index.php and adjust the variables
    according to your blog's informations and database structure.
    This is the only required step.

    for a better looking feed URL, for example to have
    yourdomain.tld/rss/

    % cd /var/www/html
    % ln -s MySQLiToRSS/rss .

    4/ Advertise your RSS feed in the webpages of your website to
    let web browsers know about its existence.
    In the header of your webpages, add the following line

    <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/rss/" title="RSS">

    And you can also add a visible link inside your webpages by
    adding the line
